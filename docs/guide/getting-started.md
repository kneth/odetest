# Getting Started

Welcome to OdeTest, a modern TypeScript calculator application that demonstrates best practices for TypeScript development with comprehensive tooling.

## What is OdeTest?

OdeTest is more than just a calculator - it's a showcase of modern TypeScript development practices including:

- **Type-safe development** with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Modern testing** with Vitest and Playwright
- **Code quality** with ESLint and Prettier
- **Documentation** with TypeDoc and VitePress
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions

## Architecture

The project is structured around three main components:

### Calculator

The main `Calculator` class provides mathematical operations with:

- Configurable precision
- Input validation
- Calculation history
- Error handling

### Math Utilities

The `MathUtils` class provides helper functions for:

- Number validation
- Rounding operations
- GCD and LCM calculations

### Type Definitions

Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:

- Calculator configuration
- Calculation results
- Error handling
